### **7. Failure Demo Description (`failure_demo.txt`)**

*This file explains the contents of the required 60s video.*

1.  **00:00 - 00:15 (Normal Operation):** 
    *   Input: Clean piano recording.
    *   Visual: Split screen. Left = Input Spectrogram, Right = Real-time MIDI piano roll generation.
    *   Audio: High fidelity reconstruction.
2.  **00:15 - 00:35 (Adversarial Input):**
    *   Input: White noise bursts mixed with heavy distortion guitar.
    *   System Reaction: The JSON log flashes "High Polyphony / Low Confidence".
    *   Output: System produces *silence* or sparse notes rather than hallucinating random chaos. This demonstrates **Failure Honesty**.
3.  **00:35 - 00:60 (Metric & Humanization):**
    *   Visual: Comparison of "Quantized" vs "Humanized" MIDI rendering.
    *   Audio: A/B switch showing the mechanical feel of raw MIDI vs the "breathe" of the humanized pipeline.
